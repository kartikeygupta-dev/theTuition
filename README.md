# 🏫 TheTuition – Teacher Enrollment & Testimonial Website

TheTuition is a responsive education website that allows teachers to enroll themselves through a form and displays enrolled teachers on a separate page using a dynamic testimonial slider.  
This project is built using **pure HTML, CSS, BootStrap, and JavaScript** and focuses on form handling, localStorage usage, and responsive UI design.
